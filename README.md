## 24 YEARS OF CONFLICT

In Colombia everyone talk about conflict, everyone talks about war, but hardly anyone understand it over time. Out side Colombia people lable us as narcos, skilled militia or the most beautiful women in the world. Hardly anyone recognize the heavy weigth of war in our eyes. This project is a personal reflection of the "art" of war during just 24 years of decades of conflict in Colombia. It's an attempt to use numbers to tell a small part of the story and led you make your own conclusions about this war. 

For me it is an opportunity to reframe thinking. Who are perpetrators? Who are victims? How does war look like? Which war techniques are more efficient? How much have we changed over time? Have we learned something?

“But if they had learned anything together, it was that wisdom 
comes to us when it can no longer do any good.”
Gabriel Garcia Marquez

In a polarized country which wisdom are we building to move forward?

## The Process
The process to make this visualizations started early on on the semester, I use the different class asignments and resources (carto, raw, jcharts) to explore different posibilities the data was offering. I found three main topics I was interested in visualizing: the number of victims due to bellicose actions, the colombian departments affected during this perios of time and the types of victims. After a digital exploration i decided to sketch and draw some other posibilities to visualize my story. after deciding the shapes and style I start looking for similar graphs i could edit with my data or tools that would allow me to do so. Like this, I made the first map altering code in a highchart chart. For the second map, i decided to use illustrator, because Carto libraries didnt have a map of colombia divided by its departments. Finally, I used raw to generate the third graph. This was and interesting process, while understanding that the data set needs to be clean and adapted according to the vosualization intended to achieve. 

## The Data
For this visualization I used [Civilianz death in bellicose actions](https://www.datos.gov.co/DataJam/Data-Jam-2017-OP-Centro-Memoria-Civiles-Muertos-Ac/6p84-qhsn) from the Colombian Center of Historic Memory. I choose this dataset because it describe in detail the date and location of the event, also the responsable group of the action and the number of victims. 

It is important to say that the data used exclude civilianz used as human shield, terrorist attacks, antipersonnel mines, ammunition without exploating and sabotage.
