## 14 YEARS OF CONFLICT

In Colombia everyone talk about conflict, everyone talks about war, but hardly anyone understand it over time. Out side Colombia people lable us as narcos, skilled militia or the most beautiful women in the world. Hardly anyone recognize the heavy weigth of war in our eyes. This project is a personal reflection of the "art" of war during just 14 years of decades of conflict in Colombia. It's an attempt to use numbers to tell a small part of the story and led you make your own conclusions about this war. 

For me it is an opportunity to reframe thinking. Who are perpetrators? Who are victims? How does war look like? Which war techniques are more efficient? How much have we changed over time? Have we learned something?

“But if they had learned anything together, it was that wisdom 
comes to us when it can no longer do any good.”
Gabriel Garcia Marquez

In a polarized country which wisdom are we building to move forward?


## The Data
For this visualization I used [Civilianz death in bellicose actions](https://www.datos.gov.co/DataJam/Data-Jam-2017-OP-Centro-Memoria-Civiles-Muertos-Ac/6p84-qhsn) from the Colombian Center of Historic Memory. I choose this dataset because it describe in detail the date and location of the event, also the responsable group of the action and the number of victims. 

It is important to say that the data used exclude civilianz used as human shield, terrorist attacks, antipersonnel mines, ammunition without exploating and sabotage.
